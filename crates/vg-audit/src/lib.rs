//! `vg-audit` — append-only, redaction-safe audit sink implementing `vg_core::AuditSink`.
//!
//! No raw values in any `AuditEvent` variant — refs/counts/versions only, property-tested
//! (`docs/architecture/interface-contracts.md` §7). That invariant belongs to the
//! *events* (the writers construct them; `vg_core::conformance::
//! assert_audit_event_excludes_raw_values` checks them); this crate's job is to persist
//! them append-only and versioned, and to never widen what an event carries.
//!
//! Storage is a JSON Lines file: one [`record::RecordV1`] per line, fsynced per write,
//! opened in `O_APPEND` mode and never truncated or rewritten. See `record` for the
//! versioned on-disk schema and `docs/decisions.md` (2026-07-17, T05b) for why JSONL
//! over SQLite.

///   in-memory indexes coherent. An offset index / shared coordination would replace this
///   if logs outgrow memory or need concurrent openers (out of Phase 1 scope).
/// - Recovery at `open` distinguishes a **torn final line** (a crash mid-append — tolerated,
///   counted in [`skipped_lines`](Self::skipped_lines), then truncated away so later appends
///   start from the last complete record) from a **complete line that fails to parse** (an
///   interior line, or
///   the final line when the file ends in a newline): the latter is corruption or tampering
///   and is a hard [`OpenError::CorruptLine`], never silently skipped. An unknown *schema

/// constructs them (Task T07) must not put raw detected values into a free-text field like
/// `Block.reason`, and `vg_core::conformance::assert_audit_event_excludes_raw_values` checks
/// that at construction time. This sink faithfully persists whatever event it is handed and
/// has no oracle for what is "raw" (it never sees the vault or the original values), so it
/// cannot and does not scrub. A caller that hands it a leaky event will persist a leaky
/// event; keeping events clean is the caller's contract, not the sink's.
