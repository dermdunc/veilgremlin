//! Library API owned by `vg-core`: `scan`/`mask`/`rehydrate`/`benchmark`, plus the
//! supporting types those signatures need (`Input`, `Context`, `Policy`, `Actor`,
//! `Destination`, `Corpus`, `Metrics`).
//!
//! T02 froze the signatures and implemented the one piece of real logic that does not
//! depend on any Wave B crate: `rehydrate`'s destination hard-deny gate. **T07 (this
//! task) wires the rest**: `scan` (parse → detect) and `mask` (classify artefact →
//! parse → detect → resolve overlaps → classify/mask each entity → audit), composing the
//! Wave B trait objects `vg-core` reaches only through `Context`/`Policy` — see
//! `docs/architecture/agent-factory-plan.md` §3. `vg-core` still does not depend on any
//! implementing crate except as dev-dependencies for the integration tests (the T04
//! precedent); the real detectors/parsers/vault/policy/audit arrive as trait objects.
//!
//! **Contract change (T07, recorded in `docs/architecture/interface-contracts.md` §2):**
//! `mask` gained a `ctx: &Context` parameter — `mask(input, ctx, policy, ns)`. The frozen
//! signature had no way to reach the detectors/parsers `scan` gets via `ctx`, and the
//! sanctioned fix per the contract-change protocol (`agent-factory-plan.md` §6) is an
//! explicit parameter, not smuggling detectors into `Policy` or pre-computing findings.

/// text approach this design rejects: only displays the pack *actually minted* can ever be
/// touched, never an arbitrary placeholder-shaped string. A spoofed `EMAIL_999` that the
/// pack never minted has no binding and is left untouched.
///
/// A binding whose value cannot be resolved under `ns` (expired, purged, or a namespace

///   act on (post overlap-resolution, so the entropy detector's `Secret` over a real email
///   is resolved to the `Email`, not double-counted), the share that do / do not match a
///   labelled expected finding. `false_positive_rate == 1 - precision`.
/// - **p95_latency_us** — p95 of the **in-process** `scan` time per sample. This is the
///   detection cost only; the report layer measures the *cold `vg hook` binary* p95
///   (process spawn + vault open + policy load + mask) separately and reports that as the
///   developer-felt number, per the banked latency measurement.
