//! Contract-conformance helpers.

//! Wave B squads (`vg-detectors`, `vg-parsers`, `vg-vault`, `vg-policy`, `vg-audit`) call
//! these from their own crate's test suite to check a trait impl against the invariants
//! named in `docs/architecture/interface-contracts.md`, without `vg-core` needing to
//! know about any concrete impl. Each function asserts internally, so it reads naturally
//! inside a `#[test]`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[test]
//! fn my_detector_is_conformant() {
//!     let d = MyDetector::default();
//!     vg_core::conformance::assert_detector_contract(&d, b"...", &[]);
//! }

//!
//! See `crates/vg-core/tests/conformance_stubs.rs` for a full worked example against
//! mock implementations of every trait.
