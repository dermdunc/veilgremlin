# Next Actions: VeilGremlin

Repo source-of-truth for the work queue. Tasks T01–T11 are defined in [`architecture/work-breakdown.md`](architecture/work-breakdown.md); the build method is in [`architecture/agent-factory-plan.md`](architecture/agent-factory-plan.md).

## Immediate (Wave A — foundation, must merge before parallel work)

- [x] **Confirm first push** to GitHub — resolved: `origin` now uses the `github.com-coderturtle`
      SSH host alias (a real fix, not the HTTPS+gh-token workaround); `main` is pushed and
      confirmed via `git ls-remote --heads origin` (2026-07-04).
- [x] **Repo ownership move to dermdunc — complete (2026-07-04).** Transferred via
      `gh api repos/coderturtle/veilgremlin/transfer -f new_owner=dermdunc`, human-accepted as
      dermdunc, visibility flipped to public
      (`gh repo edit dermdunc/veilgremlin --visibility public --accept-visibility-change-consequences`),
      local `origin` repointed to `git@github.com:dermdunc/veilgremlin.git`, and confirmed
      reachable via `git ls-remote origin`. `.hekton/project.yaml`, `.hekton/governance.yaml`,
      `.hekton/risk-register.yaml`, the repo-local mind-palace mirror, and the `Owner:`/`Privacy
      boundary:` headers in `README.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`/`CODEX.md`/`docs/spec/...` all
      updated to match. See `docs/decisions.md` for the full record.
- [x] **Corrected 2026-07-14: the "no Rust toolchain" blocker above was stale.** Re-checked
      against `agentic-control-tower/docs/go-live-dependencies.md` (which had already found the
      toolchain installed on 2026-07-07) and independently re-verified: `cargo`/`rustc` were
      already present via Homebrew. Only `cargo-deny` was actually missing — installed this
      session (`brew install cargo-deny`). `check-prereqs.sh` still needs the prereq-check
      update named below; not applied this session (prepared as a reviewed diff in
      `~/hekton`'s `docs/plans/veilgremlin-v1-dogfood-runbook-v1.md`).
- [x] **GO-LIVE dispatch, real, 2026-07-14.** `dag dispatch T01` ran for real through
      `agentic-control-tower` + `engine-gateway-lab` — the factory's first real end-to-end
      build event. **Finding:** the nested `claude -p --permission-mode acceptEdits` headless
      call stalled on a Bash-command permission prompt (checking for the Rust toolchain — the
      very blocker just corrected above) with no human to approve it, and returned a
      "waiting on your approval" message as its final answer instead of erroring — `dag status`
      showed `in-progress` with a clean exit and nothing built. This is a real unattended-dispatch
      gap (headless `-p` mode has no path to approve a Bash tool call), not a VeilGremlin-specific
      bug — worth flagging to `engine-gateway-lab`/`agentic-control-tower` for their own
      unattended-loop work. **Resolution this session:** built T01 directly instead of retrying
      the nested dispatch (human decision, given the toolchain question was already answered) —
      see the T01 entry below.
- [x] **T01 — done, 2026-07-14.** Cargo workspace (9 crates: `vg-core`, `vg-detectors`,
      `vg-parsers`, `vg-vault`, `vg-policy`, `vg-audit`, `vg-cli`, `vg-adapters-claude`,
      `vg-bench`) + CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: fmt, clippy -D warnings, cargo-deny,
      cargo-audit, build --locked, bench compile-check) + `deny.toml` + release skeleton
      (`release/README.md`, SBOM/signing stubs). Crates are empty skeletons per
      `interface-contracts.md`'s note that Squad 0 (T02) owns the canonical trait/type
      definitions — this task scaffolds the workspace they'll land in. Verified locally:
      `cargo build --locked && cargo fmt --check` (the DAG's own verify command) passes;
      also `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`, `cargo deny check`,
      and `cargo audit` all pass; `cargo bench --workspace --locked --no-run` compiles. PR
      opened against `main` from `gateway/run-20260714-T01`.
- [ ] **T02** — Freeze shared types + library API in `vg-core`; finalise `architecture/interface-contracts.md` v1 — *Squad 0*

## This Week (Wave B — dispatch in parallel once T01+T02 merge)

- [ ] **T03/T04** detectors + placeholder/HMAC keying — *Squad 1 (+3)*
- [ ] **T08** parsers (logs, diffs, JSON/YAML, `.env`, tree-sitter) — *Squad 2*
- [ ] **T05** SQLCipher vault + keychain wrap + TTL — *Squad 3*
- [ ] **T05b** audit sink (append-only, redaction-safe) — *Squad 5*
- [ ] **T06** native 3-layer policy engine — *Squad 4*

## Later (Wave C/D)

- [ ] **T07** masking pipeline wiring in `vg-core` — *Squad 0*
- [ ] **T09** `vg` CLI + Claude Code adapter + Bedrock path + demask gate — *Squad 6*
- [ ] **T10** seeded corpus + eval harness + Go/No-Go report — *Squad 7*
- [ ] **T11** review + `/security-review` + milestone sign-off — *Review Agent + human*
- [x] Decide repo visibility flip (private → public) — decided 2026-07-04: public, as part of
      the dermdunc ownership move above, not deferred to a later open-source milestone.
- [ ] ~~Fix coderturtle SSH key registration~~ — superseded 2026-07-04: the repo is moving off
      coderturtle entirely, so this is moot for VeilGremlin (the SSH host alias itself
      (`github.com-coderturtle`) remains fine for other coderturtle-owned repos).
