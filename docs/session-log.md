# Session Log: VeilGremlin

## 2026-07-04 - Repo ownership moved to dermdunc (public); build dispatch still deferred

Reviewed readiness to dispatch T01/T02 for real through `agentic-control-tower`'s task-DAG
orchestrator. Confirmed the DAG (`dag status`) shows both ready and the earlier GitHub-push
blocker was already resolved (an SSH host-alias fix, not just the HTTPS workaround). Found a new
blocker — no Rust toolchain on this machine — and, separately, coderturtle decided to hold off
starting real VeilGremlin build work until the wider Hekton factory-readiness pass is further
along. No build code was written and nothing was dispatched this session.

Separately, coderturtle determined VeilGremlin's GitHub account was wrong: it's an enterprise
architecture/governance/risk tool, not agentic-engineering tooling, so it belongs under
`dermdunc` (public), not `coderturtle` (private). Executed that move end-to-end.

### Changed / created files

- `.hekton/project.yaml`, `.hekton/governance.yaml`, `.hekton/risk-register.yaml` — owner,
  `github_account`, `github_remote_url`, `privacy_boundary` updated to dermdunc/public.
- `.hekton/change-log.yaml`, `.hekton/agent-run-log.yaml` — CHG-0002 / RUN-0002 entries for this move.
- `mind-palace/.../index.md` — owner/privacy_boundary updated to match.
- `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CODEX.md`, `docs/spec/requirements-and-design-spec.md` —
  `Owner:`/`Privacy boundary:` headers updated to dermdunc/public.
- `docs/decisions.md` — new ADR row + full entry recording the ownership/visibility move.
- `docs/next-actions.md` — GitHub-push item confirmed resolved; Rust-toolchain gap logged;
  T01/T02 dispatch re-deferred with reason; visibility-flip and SSH-key items closed as
  decided/superseded.
- `docs/risks.md` — RISK-0010 closed as moot (repo no longer pushes as coderturtle at all).
- `docs/project-walkthrough.md` — dated update entry + open-question line resolved.

### Decisions Made

- Dispatch T01/T02 deliberately deferred again — not a technical blocker this time, a human call
  to wait for the wider Hekton readiness pass. The newly-found Rust-toolchain gap is logged but
  intentionally not fixed yet (no point installing a toolchain for a build that isn't starting today).
- GitHub repo transferred `coderturtle/veilgremlin` → `dermdunc/veilgremlin` and made public in
  the same session, ahead of any real code existing — the safer order (nothing sensitive to leak
  by going public early, given zero implementation exists yet).

### Assumptions

- `dermdunc` is the correct long-term public identity for enterprise architecture/governance/risk
  factory-output projects, per the new Hekton-wide routing guidance this session also added to
  `~/hekton/config/github-accounts.yaml`.

### Risks / issues

- Repo is now public with zero implementation — low risk (nothing to leak yet), but any future
  session should assume anything committed from this point is world-readable immediately.
- No Rust toolchain installed — will block the very first dispatch (`T01`'s verify command needs
  `cargo`) whenever the deferred build session actually starts.

### Next Actions

- See `docs/next-actions.md` — Rust toolchain install + `check-prereqs.sh` update, then T01/T02
  dispatch, whenever the human decides the wider Hekton readiness pass is far enough along.

### Validation status

- `scripts/verify-project.sh` — passed (all required files present).
- `git ls-remote origin` and `gh api repos/dermdunc/veilgremlin` both confirmed the transfer +
  public visibility took effect.
- Mind-palace: repo-local mirror updated to match; live vault sync run via
  `scripts/sync-mirror-to-vault.sh` this same session (see commit in the vault repo).

## 2026-06-30 - Design & scaffold (factory-output)

Scaffolded VeilGremlin as a Hekton **factory-output** project and loaded it with the full Phase 0/1 design plus an agent-factory build plan. No implementation code yet (Hekton rule: stop before building unless asked).

### Changed / created files

- `docs/spec/requirements-and-design-spec.md` — full Phase 0/1 requirements & design spec (canonical), with all six Mermaid diagrams and Go/No-Go criteria.
- `docs/architecture/agent-factory-plan.md` — how teams of agents build VeilGremlin: squad topology, four build waves, contract-first method, DoD, git/PR protocol, quality gates.
- `docs/architecture/work-breakdown.md` — task DAG T01–T11 with owners, dependencies, acceptance.
- `docs/architecture/interface-contracts.md` — frozen crate seams (traits/types) enabling parallel agent work.
- `docs/research/deep-research-report.md` — source research report (copied in for provenance).
- `docs/architecture.md` — rewritten as architecture index.
- `docs/decisions.md` — ADR-001…ADR-010 + build-method decision.
- `docs/next-actions.md` — Wave A/B/C/D queue.
- `docs/project-walkthrough.md` — plain-English explainer.
- `docs/risks.md` — added product/build risks.
- `README.md` — real overview.
- `mind-palace/.../brief.md`, `mind-palace/.../index.md` — project brief mirror.

### Decisions Made

- Classification: factory-output; owner coderturtle; repo **private** initially (reversible).
- Core = Rust; vault = SQLCipher; placeholders not synthetic; demask explicit/local/gated; LiteLLM later; supply-chain (sign+SBOM+reproducible) first-class. (ADR-001…010.)
- Build method = contract-first agent factory (squad-per-crate, frozen interfaces, eval-gated).

### Assumptions

- coderturtle is the intended GitHub owner (stated by user); private-first is the safe default for a brand-new repo.
- The deep research report at `~/Downloads/deep-research-report-3.md` is the authoritative source context.

### Risks / issues

- **Push blocked:** the SSH alias `github.com-coderturtle` authenticates as **dermdunc** (its key is registered to dermdunc, not coderturtle), so `git push` over SSH to the private `coderturtle/veilgremlin` fails ("Repository not found"). Repo *was* created on GitHub under coderturtle. Workaround: push over HTTPS with coderturtle's `gh` token. Long-term fix: register `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_coderturtle.pub` on the coderturtle GitHub account, or standardise the remote on HTTPS.

### Next Actions

- Confirm first push (HTTPS+gh token path documented in next-actions).
- Dispatch Wave A: T01 (workspace+CI) and T02 (freeze contracts).
- Then batch-dispatch Wave B squads (T03/04, T05, T05b, T06, T08).

### Validation status

- `just validate-taxonomy` not yet run this session — recommend running before/after first push.
- Mind-palace: vault card + session-log created by scaffold; repo is source of truth (boundary rule). Vault mutation not performed beyond scaffold output (`vault_mutation_allowed: false`).

## Session: GO-LIVE dispatch (real) + T01 built directly

**Date:** 2026-07-14

### What Changed

Real `dag dispatch T01` run through `agentic-control-tower` + `engine-gateway-lab` — the
factory's first end-to-end build event. The dispatch mechanism worked correctly (worktree
isolation, routing, verify gate), but the nested `claude -p --permission-mode acceptEdits`
headless call stalled on a Bash-command permission prompt with no human to approve it, and
returned a "waiting on your approval" message instead of building anything — verify correctly
failed on the missing `Cargo.toml`. Built T01 directly instead of retrying the nested dispatch:
a 9-crate Cargo workspace (`vg-core`, `vg-detectors`, `vg-parsers`, `vg-vault`, `vg-policy`,
`vg-audit`, `vg-cli`, `vg-adapters-claude`, `vg-bench`), `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `deny.toml`,
and a release skeleton (SBOM/signing stubbed).

### Decisions

See `docs/decisions.md` (2026-07-14 entry) for the full record: why direct build over retrying
with a looser permission mode, the cargo-deny wildcard-dependency fix, and the flagged
unattended-dispatch gap for `engine-gateway-lab`/`agentic-control-tower`.

### Assumptions

Empty skeleton crates are correct for T01 — `interface-contracts.md` names Squad 0/Task T02 as
the owner of the canonical trait/type definitions, so T01's job is the workspace + CI they land
in, not the types themselves.

### Risks

The dispatch-mechanism gap (headless `-p` mode cannot approve a Bash tool call) will recur for
any future task whose agent tries to run a Bash command mid-task — flagged in
`docs/next-actions.md`, not fixed here (out of scope for a VeilGremlin build task).

### Next Actions

- T02 next (freeze `vg-core` shared types + `interface-contracts.md` v1). Wave B does not
  dispatch until T01 and T02 both merge.
- Review/merge the T01 PR (`gateway/run-20260714-T01` → `main`).
- Flag the unattended-dispatch permission-mode gap to `engine-gateway-lab`/
  `agentic-control-tower` (separate repos, not addressed here).

### Validation status

- `cargo build --locked && cargo fmt --check` (the DAG's own verify command): PASS.
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`: PASS.
- `cargo deny check`: PASS locally (advisories/bans/licenses/sources all ok) — **but this was
  local-only and wrong**: the real GitHub Actions `deny` job was `runs-on: macos-latest`, and
  `cargo-deny-action@v2` is a Docker container action requiring Linux — CI failed on every push.
  Caught by a doubt-driven-development pass later the same day (see the follow-up session entry
  below); fixed to `ubuntu-latest`; the real CI run now shows all 6 jobs passing.
- `cargo audit`: PASS (0 vulnerabilities, 76 dependencies scanned).
- `cargo bench --workspace --locked --no-run`: compiles clean.

---

## Session: Doubt-driven-development round 2 (Codex cross-model) + fixes

**Date:** 2026-07-14

### What Changed

After round 1's fix (CI's `deny` job to `ubuntu-latest`, confirmed green on the real GitHub
Actions run), ran a Codex cross-model review of the same PR. Found and fixed: no `cargo test`
CI job existed at all; the Rust toolchain was unpinned (`dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`, no
`rust-toolchain.toml`); `docs/risks.md`'s RISK-0002 mitigation implied bench gating was already
enforced when it isn't (no hot-path code exists yet to benchmark); `scripts/check-prereqs.sh`,
`docs/local-assumptions.md`, and `scripts/verify-project.sh` still didn't check for the Rust
toolchain at all — the exact gap flagged on 2026-07-04 and never actually applied, applied now;
every crate hardcoded `version = "0.1.0"` on its intra-workspace path dependencies instead of
inheriting from `[workspace.dependencies]`, which would silently drift on a version bump; and,
found independently while double-checking round 1's own fix, `docs/project-walkthrough.md` now
claimed "T01 is merged" when the PR is still open — round 1 fixed a stale claim and introduced a
new one in the same edit.

### Decisions

Added `rust-toolchain.toml` pinning `1.96.1` (matches this machine's installed version) and
updated every CI job's `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` to `@1.96.1`. Added a `test` CI job
(`cargo test --workspace --locked`) even though there are zero tests today — the job should
exist before T02 adds the first ones, not be retrofitted after. Refactored intra-workspace
dependencies through `[workspace.dependencies]` + `{ workspace = true }` (idiomatic Cargo
pattern) rather than a literal `version = "0.1.0"` in 8 places. Applied the prereq-check fix
that had been sitting prepared-but-unapplied since the VeilGremlin v1 dogfood runbook was
written earlier this session.

### Risks

None new; this is entirely hardening of what round 1 already shipped.

### Next Actions

- Human: review and merge the T01 PR.
- After merge: build/dispatch T02.

### Validation status

- `cargo build --locked && cargo fmt --check`: PASS (re-verified after the workspace-dependency
  refactor).
- `rust-toolchain.toml` added; CI actions pinned to match.
- Real GitHub Actions run confirmed green (all 6 original jobs; `test` job added but not yet
  re-run against the push — confirm on next CI run before merging).

## Session: T01 built + two doubt-driven-development rounds + PR merged

**Date:** 2026-07-14 22:11

### What Changed

Built Task T01 (9-crate Cargo workspace + CI + supply-chain skeleton) after the real ACT GO-LIVE dispatch stalled on a headless permission-mode gap. Ran two doubt-driven-development rounds (single-model, then Codex cross-model) that found and fixed a red CI job (cargo-deny-action needs Linux runners), missing test/toolchain-pin CI, stale reproducibility scripts, hardcoded dependency versions, and several stale-doc overclaims (including one round 1 itself introduced). Rewrote all 3 commits to use the Hekton commit footer (Hekton-Engine/Harness/Model/Workflow) instead of the generic Claude Code co-author line. PR #2 merged to main.

### Decisions

Built T01 directly rather than retry/loosen the nested dispatch's permission mode. Fixed the CI red job (ubuntu-latest for cargo-deny) rather than remove the check. Refactored intra-workspace deps through [workspace.dependencies] instead of hardcoded per-crate versions. Rewrote (not amended-in-place) the 3 commits via reset+cherry-pick to apply the Hekton footer, since they were already pushed with an open PR.

### Assumptions

Assumed the Hekton footer's engine=claude/harness=claude-code/model=claude-sonnet-5/workflow=t01-workspace-scaffold values are the right ones for this interactive-session build, per hekton-cli-lab's hkt commit schema.

### Risks

Branch name (gateway/run-20260714-T01) never matched agent-factory-plan.md's feat/<squad>-<task-id>-<slug> convention -- flagged, not fixed (already merged now, moot going forward for this branch but the dispatch tooling's naming convention still doesn't match VeilGremlin's own git contract for future tasks).

### Next Actions

- [x] Dispatch/build T02 — done 2026-07-15.

---

## Session: T02 built (real dispatch, picked up after a tool timeout)

**Date:** 2026-07-15

### What Changed

Retried the real ACT GO-LIVE dispatch for T02. First attempt hit a transient API connection
error; second attempt actually did the real work (7 new files, 787 lines: `vg-core`'s shared
types, trait seams, `rehydrate`'s hard-deny gate implemented for real, contract-conformance
test helpers + worked example) but was killed by a ~10-minute tool timeout before it could
close out formally — no stall this time, genuine progress cut short. Picked up in place: ran
`cargo build` to lock the 3 new dependencies (`thiserror`, `uuid`, `zeroize`), applied `cargo
fmt --all` (the interrupted run hadn't reached formatting), then verified the actual T02
`verify_command` end to end — all green, including 6 real tests.

### Decisions

Continued the interrupted work rather than re-dispatching from scratch or discarding it —
verified independently (build, clippy, fmt, test, plus reading the actual generated code
against `interface-contracts.md`) before trusting it, given this is the frozen contract every
later task builds against.

### Assumptions

None new.

### Risks

None new. Branch-naming mismatch (same issue as T01) still unresolved — see decisions.md.

### Next Actions

- [x] Doubt-driven-development pass — done 2026-07-15, see below.
- Human: review/merge the T02 PR.
- Once T01 + T02 both merge: batch-dispatch Wave B (T03/T04, T05, T05b, T06, T08).

### Validation status

- `cargo build --locked && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo fmt --check &&
  cargo test` (T02's own verify_command): PASS, 6 tests green.

---

## Session: Doubt-driven-development on T02 (two rounds) + fixes

**Date:** 2026-07-15

### What Changed

Ran the same two-round process as T01 (single-model, then Codex cross-model) against the T02
PR. Most severe finding: `interface-contracts.md` was never touched despite being T02's literal
acceptance criterion, still read "DRAFT," and was missing 11 types the real code needed. Most
severe *code* finding: the conformance example's `MockVault::resolve` ignored its namespace
parameter entirely — a value interned under one namespace would resolve under any other. Fixed
both, plus five more conformance-helper gaps (no `PolicyEngine` helper, an audit-escaping
false-negative, `MaskedPack`'s check missing a field, missing span-bounds validation, `Sized`
bounds blocking `dyn Trait` callers) and one documented-not-fixed contract-shape limitation
(`Secret`'s zeroize-on-drop is cosmetic given `rehydrate`'s own frozen return type).

### Decisions

Reconciled `interface-contracts.md` in the same PR rather than a separate contract-change PR,
since nothing has consumed the "frozen" contract yet (Wave B hasn't dispatched) — see
decisions.md for the full record and rationale on each fix.

### Risks

None new. The vault namespace-isolation bug is now caught by a passing test
(`assert_vault_roundtrip` requires a second, distinct namespace and asserts cross-namespace
resolution fails) rather than silently absent.

### Next Actions

- Human: review/merge the T02 PR (both interface-contracts.md and the code fixes are now in it).
- Once T01 + T02 both merge: batch-dispatch Wave B.

### Validation status

- `cargo build --locked && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo fmt --check &&
  cargo test`: PASS, 7 tests green in `vg-core` (was 6 — added the cross-namespace-rejection
  coverage and the adversarial-buffer parser battery).

## Session: T03 built (first genuinely unattended `code-implement` completion) + two rounds of doubt-driven-development + tollgate approved

### What happened with the dispatch

First attempt: terse one-line task prompt got a clarifying question back from headless
`claude -p` instead of any code — a real, previously-unseen failure mode (one-shot mode has
no follow-up channel, so the question was the entire session; the adapter still exited 0, so
the gateway ledger recorded `in-progress` as if something legitimate happened, and ACT's own
verify step trivially passed against the unchanged pre-existing code). Blocked via
`control-tower session block T03`, root-caused, and fixed at the task-spec level: rewrote the
description with concrete file/module/trait guidance plus an explicit "use your judgment,
don't ask" instruction, in both `.hekton/veilgremlin-dag.toml` (the source of truth) and the
regenerated `.hekton/build-tasks/T03.md`. Unblocked, reclaimed the stale worktree
(`review-prune`), re-dispatched.

Second attempt: real work — five detector modules (`email.rs`, `phone.rs`, `ip.rs`,
`iban_sortcode.rs`, `entropy.rs`, ~800 lines) plus a criterion bench, matching the prompt
closely. Verify initially failed on a `Cargo.lock` mismatch (new `regex`/`criterion` deps
never locked) and one clippy unused-import — both mechanical fixes in the worktree, not logic
changes. Full verify chain green after.

### Doubt-driven-development (two rounds, Codex cross-model both times)

Full findings and reconciliation are in `docs/decisions.md`'s 2026-07-15/16 entries — not
repeated here. Summary: round 1 found 9 issues (3 real bugs fixed: IPv4-mapped-IPv6 partial
match, entropy detector missing password special characters, a resulting IP self-overlap;
rest documented trade-offs or refuted against the actual task breakdown). Round 2 verified
those three fixes and found 5 more (2 real trade-offs the fixes themselves introduced,
documented not fixed; rest pre-existing or duplicate of round 1's findings). Stopped at two
cycles per the doubt-driven-development skill's own guidance.

### Tollgate

Approved by the human via `gateway-review.sh --task T03` — surfaced a real, previously-unhit
bug in that script (see Risks below) along the way, worked around live so the review could
proceed. Diff applied to the real repo, worktree pruned, `human_confirmed: true`,
`status: done`. `control-tower session close T03` recorded the summary.

### Decisions

See `docs/decisions.md` 2026-07-15/16 entries for the full detector-review reconciliation.

### Risks

Found (in `engine-gateway-lab`, not this repo): `gateway-review.sh` resolves
`output_artifact` relative to its own repo root unconditionally, which is wrong for
ACT-dispatched, worktree-isolated tasks whose spec (and therefore real output) lives in a
different repo — this is the first time that exact review code path has been exercised with
real output waiting (T01 never produced output, T02 was applied by hand outside this flow).
Logged as `engine-gateway-lab`'s RISK-0017; worked around for T03 with a placeholder file at
the wrong path, not fixed at the root this session.

### Next Actions

- Human: review/merge the T03 PR once opened.
- Decide serial-vs-concurrent for the remaining five Wave B tasks (T04/T05/T05b/T06/T08),
  now that T03's pilot has proven the rework loop (block → unblock → re-dispatch) and the
  RISK-0016 ledger fix, both for real. Per the runbook, default serial unless a future task
  runs cleanly unattended.
- `engine-gateway-lab`'s RISK-0017 (output-path resolution bug) needs a real fix before it's
  relied on again for cross-repo worktree tasks — not blocking, since the workaround is known
  and cheap to repeat, but worth closing before it's hit under less attention.

### Validation status

- `cargo build --locked && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo fmt --check &&
  cargo test`: PASS, 41 tests green in `vg-detectors`, confirmed in both the worktree and the
  real repo after the tollgate applied the diff.
- Criterion bench: ~0.62ms against the 25ms p95 budget.

## Session: Fan-out testing-strategy review + real CI latency gate + Codex dogfooding plan + real detector census

### What happened

Human asked to merge the T03 PR, get a status report, and review the fan-out phases
against VeilGremlin's actual goal (mask PII by design, be an invisible control, treat
latency with trading-system discipline). Merged T03's PR (#5) and `engine-gateway-lab`'s
RISK-0017 PR (#25). Reviewed `interface-contracts.md`'s real budget (p95 < 25ms, not
microseconds — clarified the "sub-microsecond trading system" framing as a *discipline*
of tail-latency awareness and CI enforcement, not a literal target humans could perceive
anyway) and found three real gaps in how Wave B/C tasks would test against each other:

- T04 (keying) and T08 (parsers) had no requirement to integration-test against T03's
  real `Finding`/`Span` output, only mock values — a real interface/shape mismatch could
  survive until T07 wires everything together.
- T09 (CLI/hooks) had no point where a human actually confirms the "invisible control"
  goal is met — latency budgets are necessary but not sufficient for "doesn't affect UX."
- There was no cheap, continuous way to exercise the real detectors against real content
  before T10's formal eval harness exists.

### Changes made

- Added a real, CI-enforced latency-regression gate (`crates/vg-detectors/tests/latency_gate.rs`,
  plain `#[test]`, 4x CI-safe slack over the 25ms budget) so every PR checks this now
  instead of waiting for T10.
- Added cross-crate integration acceptance criteria to T04 and T08, and a human
  UX-latency-verification criterion to T09, in `.hekton/veilgremlin-dag.toml` (source of
  truth) and regenerated `.hekton/build-tasks/{T04,T08,T09}.md`; mirrored in
  `docs/architecture/work-breakdown.md`.
- Asked a Codex subagent to plan (not review — explicitly a planning task) how to
  dogfood VeilGremlin as it's built, to benchmark and find edge cases early. Reconciled
  its plan against the actual codebase in `docs/decisions.md`; its independent conclusion
  matched the plain-`#[test]` latency-gate design already chosen.
- Built and ran `crates/vg-detectors/examples/census.rs`, a read-only tool (never prints
  or stores matched values, only counts/spans/entity-types/latency) against 197 real
  files across VeilGremlin and `engine-gateway-lab`.

### Census findings

Latency is fine: 11.2ms total across 197 files (0.057ms/file avg). But entropy (2468
findings) and phone (783 findings) detectors are dominated by false positives — verified
by hand that `engine-gateway-lab/docs/session-log.md` contains real `run-YYYYMMDD-EG-NNN`
shaped operational IDs that are exactly the byte-length/mixed-character shape the entropy
detector was tuned to catch. This is a genuine, evidenced precision problem, not a
latency problem, and it is **not decided or guessed at this session** — see Next Actions.

### Decisions

Full record (latency-gate design, DAG acceptance-criteria additions, Codex plan
reconciliation, and the census finding) in `docs/decisions.md`'s 2026-07-16 entry.

### Next Actions

- **Human decision needed:** how to address the entropy/phone false-positive rate before
  T06 (policy)/T07 (pipeline) go live — options include an operational-ID allowlist,
  tighter entropy heuristics, or deferring to T10's formal `false_positive_rate` metric.
  Not a call to make without the human.
- Re-run the census as each Wave B/C task lands, per the Codex plan's ladder
  (detector-only now -> +parsers after T08 -> stubbed mini-pipeline after
  T04/T05/T06/T05b -> real `mask()` after T07 -> real dogfood after T09).
- Serial-vs-concurrent for the remaining Wave B tasks (T04/T05/T05b/T06/T08) is still
  open from the prior session.

### Validation status

- `cargo test -p vg-detectors`: PASS, including the new `latency_gate.rs` test
  (p95 well within the 4x CI-safe margin).
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` and `cargo fmt --check`: PASS after fixing
  2 clippy findings in the new `census.rs` example.
- Full workspace verify chain re-confirmed before opening the PR (#6) for this round.

## Session: Fixed the entropy/phone false-positive finding (Codex-planned, hybrid, measured)

### What happened

Asked Codex to plan out the three open options from the census finding (allowlist,
tighter heuristics, defer to T10) before deciding. Codex read the actual frozen
`PolicyEngine`/`Detector` contracts and the real detector code, then recommended a
hybrid: fix the two dominant detector-level false positives now, keep T10 as the formal
gate, and explicitly deprioritized a policy-layer allowlist (no per-finding hook in the
frozen contract; a regex allowlist is also a potential bypass-surface risk). Human
approved the hybrid.

Implemented `looks_like_iso_date` in `PhoneDetector` (excludes strict `YYYY-MM-DD`
shapes) and `is_structured_identifier` in `EntropyDetector`. The entropy fix needed a
mid-session correction: the first version assumed Hekton's own `run-YYYYMMDD-EG-NNN` run
IDs were the dominant shape (matching the census's original hypothesis) and barely
moved the needle when measured (1 of 1849 findings removed on real `engine-gateway-lab`
content, via a temporary local debug print, never committed). The real dominant classes
were file paths and snake_case/kebab-case identifiers — corrected to a generic
delimiter-splitting rule (segments must be purely alphabetic or purely numeric) that
catches both shapes without a Hekton-specific dictionary.

### Measured impact (isolated before/after via `git stash` on identical, untouched
`engine-gateway-lab` content)

```
                 before   after
entropy          1849     182    (-90%)
phone            618      54     (-91%)
```

Latency unaffected. The remaining ~10% is left for T10's formal `false_positive_rate`
gate, per the hybrid decision, not silently ignored.

### Decisions

Full record, including the mid-session correction and why "measure on real content, not
theory" mattered here concretely, in `docs/decisions.md`'s 2026-07-16 entry.

### Next Actions

- Re-run the census as each Wave B/C task lands (still open from the prior session).
- Serial-vs-concurrent decision for the remaining Wave B tasks still open.

### Validation status

- `cargo build --locked && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo fmt --check
  && cargo test`: PASS, 46 tests green in `vg-detectors` (5 new: 2 phone date-exclusion,
  3 entropy structured-identifier tests, built from the real false-positive examples
  found).

## Session: Merged PR #6; added a build log

### What happened

Merged PR #6 (fan-out review, latency gate, DAG acceptance criteria, Codex dogfooding
plan, real census, and the entropy/phone false-positive fix), pulled `main` up to date.

Human asked for a build log tracking work in this repo, similar to the Hekton Workshop
Gremlin's `docs/build-log/` convention and, to a degree, the Hekton Field Journal. Asked
what scope was wanted rather than assume it; human chose lightweight dated docs only, no
publishing site yet.

### Changes made

Added `docs/build-log/README.md` (the convention: one entry per real event, written for
a reader without context, not a mechanical summary of this file) plus 7 backfilled
entries covering the repo's history from the initial scaffold through the entropy/phone
false-positive fix. Wired the convention into `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`CODEX.md` as a
standing rule for future sessions, and linked it from `README.md` and
`docs/project-walkthrough.md` — which also got a real content refresh, since it had
gone stale claiming T01's PR was open and no business logic existed.

### Decisions

Full record in `docs/decisions.md`'s 2026-07-17 entry.

### Next Actions

- Decide serial-vs-concurrent for the remaining Wave B tasks (T04/T05/T05b/T06/T08) —
  still open.
- Add a build-log entry as each future task lands, per the new standing rule.
- Revisit whether the build log earns a publishable site later (Astro-on-Pages, per the
  Workshop Gremlin's pattern) — not needed yet since this repo is already public.

### Validation status

- Docs-only change this session; no Rust code touched. Full workspace verify chain
  (`cargo build --locked && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo fmt
  --check && cargo test`) last confirmed green in the prior session's entry above.

## Session: T04 — typed-placeholder + HMAC keying (headless dispatch, 2026-07-17)

### What happened

Headless one-shot dispatch of Task T04. Implemented `crates/vg-core/src/keying.rs`: the
`VaultStore`-authoritative formula ("stable placeholder via salted HMAC over
`(canonical(value), ty, ns)`") plus the four supporting pieces the task spec named —
type-specific case/whitespace canonicalisation, per-`(Namespace, EntityType)` sequential
ordinal assignment for the `EMAIL_001`/`ACCOUNT_ID_014`-style `display` string, Luhn and
ISO 7064 mod-97-10 checksum validators, and a `Mutex`-backed session-scoped cache
(`Keyer`) so repeated keying of the same value doesn't recompute the HMAC. Added an
integration test (`crates/vg-core/tests/keying_integration.rs`) feeding real `Finding`s
from `vg-detectors::all_detectors()` (Task T03) through the new keying logic, per the
2026-07-16 cross-crate integration requirement added to this task's acceptance criteria.

### Changes made

- `crates/vg-core/src/keying.rs` (new) — `canonicalize`, `placeholder_key`,
  `PlaceholderKey`, `Keyer`/`Keyed`, `luhn_is_valid`, `iban_mod97_is_valid`, plus 25 unit
  tests.
- `crates/vg-core/src/lib.rs` — wired in `mod keying;` and its public re-exports.
- `crates/vg-core/Cargo.toml` — added `hmac`/`sha2` dependencies; added a dev-only
  `vg-detectors` dependency for the integration test.
- `crates/vg-core/tests/keying_integration.rs` (new) — 5 tests against real T03 detector
  output.
- `docs/decisions.md` — new 2026-07-17 T04 entry recording five judgment calls (see
  below) made without a follow-up channel to ask.

### Decisions

Full record in `docs/decisions.md`'s 2026-07-17 T04 entry: type-specific case-folding
(not blanket); caller-supplied HMAC salt (`vg-core` doesn't own persistent key storage);
an explicit separator byte in the HMAC message to prevent field-concatenation collisions;
ordinals scoped per `(Namespace, EntityType)`; and — the one worth flagging here
specifically — Luhn/mod-97 are exposed as pure validators but deliberately **not** wired
into `display` construction to synthesize a fake-but-checksum-valid card/IBAN number,
since that would conflict with ADR-005's frozen "typed placeholders, not synthetic
values" decision (2026-06-30).

### Assumptions

- Ordinal sequences are independent per namespace (each `Namespace` gets its own
  `EMAIL_001, EMAIL_002, ...`), not a single counter shared globally per `EntityType`
  across all namespaces — read from the acceptance criterion's "same value -> same
  placeholder **within namespace**" framing.
- `EntityType::Custom(name)`'s display tag upper-snake-cases the dictionary name
  (`internal-project-codename` -> `CUSTOM_INTERNAL_PROJECT_CODENAME`) rather than using
  the raw string, for consistency with the fixed types' `TYPE_TAG_NNN` shape.

### Risks

None new. This module doesn't touch the vault, policy, or audit paths yet — those land
with `vg-vault` (T05), which will be the first real caller of `Keyer`/`placeholder_key`.

### Next Actions

- T05 (`vg-vault`) should call into this module from `VaultStore::intern` rather than
  reimplementing keying — that's the whole point of building it standalone first.
- Remaining Wave B tasks (T05/T05b/T06/T08) still open.

### Validation status

**Not run in the dispatch session** — a fully headless, sandboxed dispatch: every
`cargo`/`rustc` invocation attempted returned an immediate "this command requires
approval" with no reachable prompt (plain shell — `find`/`grep`/`git status` — worked
fine, so this reads as a policy gating toolchain execution specifically, not a general
Bash block). The code was written and hand-traced carefully against the `hmac`/`sha2`
crate APIs and existing crate conventions, including manually verifying the Luhn and
mod-97 test vectors by hand digit-by-digit.

**Verified during PR review:** `cargo build --locked` compiled clean (only `Cargo.lock`
needed regenerating for the two new dependencies). `cargo clippy --workspace
--all-targets --locked -- -D warnings` found one trivial modern-lint finding
(`.is_multiple_of(10)` over `% 10 == 0`), fixed. `cargo fmt --check` found routine
reformatting (file had never been run through `cargo fmt`), applied. Full suite green
after: 32 `keying` unit tests + 5 cross-crate integration tests + the existing 7 `vg-core`
conformance tests, all passing — every hand-traced Luhn/mod-97 vector confirmed correct.

## Session: T04 doubt-pass, tollgate approval, PR consolidation, and merge

### What happened

Ran a Codex cross-model adversarial review on T04's diff before submitting for tollgate
approval. Found and fixed 3 real bugs: an `EntityType::Custom` HMAC collision (different
dictionary names with similar display formatting keyed identically), compact-vs-spaced
IBAN/sort-code/phone values canonicalising to different placeholders (a direct violation
of "same value -> same placeholder"), and `PlaceholderKey`'s `Debug` impl leaking the
full HMAC hex. Fixed a documentation gap in `iban_mod97_is_valid`'s scope. Found and
recorded (not fixable in T04 alone) a real cross-task interface gap: T05's `VaultStore`
must reseed `Keyer`'s ordinal counters from persisted vault state, added as a hard
requirement in T05's own acceptance criteria and `depends_on`.

Ran a second Codex pass fact-checking the dispatch's own self-reported output file
against the actual repo state — mostly found expected drift (the report predates the
fixes above), but caught one genuine, if minor, inaccuracy in the original self-report
(undercounted its own decisions.md entry's judgment calls, 5 vs. the actual 6) and one
real error in **my own** documentation (`docs/decisions.md` said "37 keying unit tests"
when 37 is `vg-core`'s total unit-test count, 31 of which are keying-specific) — fixed.

Tollgate-approved by the human via `gateway-review.sh`, which hit the same RISK-0017
output-path bug as T03 (worked around identically: a placeholder file at the wrong path
pointing to the real output location, not a fix at the root).

While preparing to apply the diff, discovered that an earlier `dag gen-specs` invocation
(scoped `--root` to the T04 worktree) had actually written its output to the **real**
veilgremlin repo instead, due to the tool resolving output paths from
`.hekton/project.yaml`'s canonical path rather than respecting `--root`. Caught
immediately via `git status`; the actual content it wrote (a T05-on-T04 DAG dependency
addition) was legitimate and intentional, so reconciled by applying the same edit
properly to the real repo's own `veilgremlin-dag.toml` rather than reverting it.

Consolidated PR #8 (T04's task-spec-guidance expansion + the T05 dependency addition)
into PR #9 (T04's actual implementation), since both ended up touching the same DAG
content; closed #8 as superseded. Merged #9. `git-guardrail` blocked the `Cargo.lock`-
touching commit from an agent session as designed; the human ran it directly.

### Decisions

Full record in `docs/decisions.md`'s 2026-07-17 entries (the doubt-driven-development
subsection under T04, and the separate "Merged T04; vault sync; fixed a real bug in
sync-mirror-to-vault.sh" entry below this session's later work).

### Risks

T05 (`vg-vault`, not yet built) has a new hard acceptance-criterion requirement (ordinal
reseeding from persisted state) that must not be silently skipped — see `docs/next-actions.md`.

### Next Actions

- Human: review/merge (done — PR #9 merged 2026-07-17T17:36:55Z).
- Decide serial-vs-concurrent for the remaining Wave B tasks (T05/T05b/T06/T08).

### Validation status

- Full workspace verify chain re-confirmed green in the real repo after the tollgate
  applied the diff and after folding in the consolidated DAG changes: `cargo build
  --locked && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo fmt --check && cargo
  test` — 37 `vg-core` unit tests (31 keying-specific), 5 integration tests, 7
  conformance tests, 46 detector tests, 1 latency-gate test, all green.

## Session: Merged PR #9; vault sync; audited and closed a build-log coverage gap

### What happened

Merged PR #9 to `main`. Backed up the Obsidian vault (`~/hekton/scripts/backup-obsidian-vault.sh`)
and ran `scripts/sync-mirror-to-vault.sh` to push the refreshed mirror `session-log.md` to
the live vault — this project's vault entry hadn't been synced since before T01, so it was
a large catch-up. The script copied the file correctly but its `git add` line silently
staged nothing (see `docs/decisions.md` for the root cause and fix): fixed the script,
manually staged/committed the pending vault update.

Human asked to confirm the build log genuinely tracks how/why/what this project is
building, since it needs to ship as part of the final delivered project the way the
coderturtle workshop build-logs do. Audited `docs/build-log/`'s 8 existing entries against
the actual work done and found one real gap: the T04 entry (written by the dispatching
agent) predates the subsequent doubt-pass and never mentions the 3 real bugs found there.
Added a second T04 entry covering that story specifically.

### Decisions

Full record in `docs/decisions.md`'s 2026-07-17 entry, "Merged T04 (PR #9); vault sync;
fixed a real bug in sync-mirror-to-vault.sh."

### Next Actions

- Re-audit build-log coverage after each future task lands, not just retroactively.
- Decide serial-vs-concurrent for the remaining Wave B tasks (T05/T05b/T06/T08) — still open.

### Validation status

- Docs/script-only change this session; no Rust code touched.

## 2026-07-17 — T05 built: SQLCipher `VaultStore` in `vg-vault` (headless dispatch, no compiler reachable)

Implemented `vg_core::traits::VaultStore` in `crates/vg-vault` (previously an empty stub crate),
plus the one additive `vg-core` change the requirement forced (`Keyer::seed_ordinal`). As with T04,
no Rust toolchain was reachable in the dispatch environment (`cargo` is gated behind interactive
approval a headless run can't satisfy), so this is left for a compile/clippy/test pass at PR review.

### What changed / created

- `crates/vg-vault/src/lib.rs` — `Vault` struct + `VaultConfig`; `VaultStore` impl (`intern`/
  `resolve`/`purge_expired`); `Vault::open` (keychain-wrapped key) and `Vault::open_with_key`
  (caller-supplied key, for tests); `demask_event_count`/`mapping_count` helpers; a compile-time
  `Send + Sync` assertion.
- `crates/vg-vault/src/schema.rs` — SQLCipher DDL: `meta`, `mapping` (with a UNIQUE index on the
  per-namespace/type ordinal), `demask_event`.
- `crates/vg-vault/src/keychain.rs` — OS-keychain wrap of the 32-byte DB key via `keyring`
  (generate-on-first-use, hex-encoded), with hex codec unit tests.
- `crates/vg-vault/src/codec.rs` — round-trippable `Namespace`/`EntityType` ↔ column encoding
  (needed so the reseed can reconstruct real keys), with round-trip unit tests.
- `crates/vg-vault/src/random.rs`, `src/error.rs` — CSPRNG helper (`getrandom`) and `VaultError`
  mapping.
- `crates/vg-vault/Cargo.toml` — added `rusqlite` (`bundled-sqlcipher-vendored-openssl`), `keyring`,
  `uuid`, `getrandom`; `tempfile` dev-dep.
- `crates/vg-vault/tests/vault.rs` — integration tests: `assert_vault_roundtrip` conformance,
  stable placeholder, sequential ordinals, **ordinal continuity across reopen** (the T05 hard
  requirement), value persistence, namespace isolation, demask logging, TTL purge, wrong-key open
  failure, session-namespace round-trip.
- `crates/vg-core/src/keying.rs` — added `Keyer::seed_ordinal` (additive; not a frozen-contract
  change) plus three unit tests. This is the reseed hook T04 flagged as required for T05.

### Decisions / assumptions

Nine recorded in `docs/decisions.md` (2026-07-17 T05 entry) — key ones: reseed via a new additive
`Keyer::seed_ordinal`; `intern` uses non-mutating `placeholder_key` for the lookup and only mints an
ordinal via `key_for` for genuinely-new values; `prepare_cached` is the "cache prepared statements"
mechanism; SQLCipher whole-DB encryption is the value-at-rest cipher (no redundant app-level layer);
per-install random salt in an encrypted `meta` table; `resolve` returns `NotFound` for both namespace
mismatch and expiry.

### Risks

- RISK-0006 (vault key mishandling / plaintext at rest): materially advanced — this is the code that
  wraps the DB key in the keychain and never writes it plaintext. Not yet verified by a build/run.

### Next actions

- PR-review compile pass: `cargo build --locked && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings &&
  cargo fmt --check && cargo test -p vg-core -p vg-vault`. Needs a C toolchain + perl for the
  vendored-OpenSSL/SQLCipher build.
- Consider a cross-model doubt-pass on the reseed/intern ordinal logic (the subtle part), as was
  done for T04.

### Validation status

Not compiled or tested in the dispatch session (no reachable toolchain).

**Verified during PR review (2026-07-17):** `bundled-sqlcipher-vendored-openssl` compiled clean;
full chain green after two fixes (a trivial `.is_multiple_of` clippy lint; a missing — and now
redacting, salt-safe — `Debug` on `Vault`). A Codex cross-model doubt-pass found and fixed one
real correctness bug (`intern` could return an expired-but-unpurged placeholder that `resolve`
rejects — now renewed in place) plus two reconciled design points (`resolve` audits denied
demasks by design; the `UNIQUE` ordinal index defends a cross-process race). 40 vg-core + 6
vg-vault unit + 14 vault integration tests green. Full record in `docs/decisions.md`.
Mind-palace updated: no (proposed — sync at PR merge, as with prior tasks).

## 2026-07-17 - T05b: audit sink implemented in vg-audit (headless dispatch, no compiler reachable)

Implemented `vg_core::traits::AuditSink` in the previously empty `vg-audit` stub crate,
per the T05b task spec: append-only JSON Lines storage (`JsonlAuditSink`, one fsynced
record per line, file never truncated), a versioned on-disk schema (`RecordV1`/`EventV1`
mirrors with explicit fallible conversions from the frozen `vg-core` types, every record
carrying `schema_version`), and the full redaction-safety test battery — conformance
roundtrips for all six `AuditEvent` variants, durability across reopen, torn-write
recovery, unknown-schema-version refusal, concurrent writers, and the acceptance property
test that no raw value ever reaches the persisted bytes (checked verbatim *and*
JSON-escaped, with a negative control proving the helper catches a leaky event).

Like T04, this dispatch had no reachable compiler — every `cargo`/`rustc` call was
permission-blocked — which shaped a real decision: the dependency set was chosen so the
required `Cargo.lock` update stayed a hand-editable dependency-edge list between
already-locked packages (`tempfile` dropped for a std-only test tempdir; uuid's `serde`
feature dropped for a `#[serde(with)]` Display-based adapter). Full rationale in
`docs/decisions.md`'s 2026-07-17 T05b entry.

### Changed / created files

- `crates/vg-audit/src/lib.rs` — `JsonlAuditSink` (open/replay/heal, fsynced append,
  in-memory index), `OpenError`.
- `crates/vg-audit/src/record.rs` — versioned storage schema v1 + conversions + pinned
  wire-format tests.
- `crates/vg-audit/tests/sink.rs` — conformance/durability/recovery/property tests.
- `crates/vg-audit/Cargo.toml` — deps (serde, serde_json, thiserror, uuid) with the
  lockfile-constraint note; `Cargo.lock` — vg-audit's dependency list (hand-edited, see
  decisions entry).
- `docs/decisions.md`, `docs/next-actions.md`, `docs/build-log/2026-07-17-an-audit-log-
  sized-to-fit-its-lockfile.md`, this file.

### Decisions

Full record in `docs/decisions.md`, 2026-07-17: "T05b audit sink: JSONL storage,
versioned schema mirrors, and dependencies chosen to fit a hand-editable lockfile."

### Next Actions

- PR review must run the standard verify chain (`cargo build --locked && cargo clippy
  --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo fmt --check && cargo test -p vg-audit`) — nothing
  was compiled in-session.
- T07 wires this sink into `mask()`'s pipeline assembly alongside T05's vault.

### Validation status

- **Not compiled or tested in the dispatch session** (toolchain permission-blocked in the
  headless dispatch). Self-review caught three would-be compile errors before handoff.
- **Verified during PR review (2026-07-17):** full verify chain green on the first real
  attempt after one `fmt` pass — `cargo build --locked && cargo clippy --workspace
  --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings && cargo fmt --check && cargo test`.
- **Codex cross-model doubt-pass (2026-07-17):** found and fixed 5 real robustness/security
  issues in the log-recovery path (UTF-8 torn-tail bricking the whole log; any unparseable
  line silently skipped rather than only the torn final one; a malformed `schema_version`
  bypassing the strict path; a duplicate `AuditId` silently shadowing; error text
  Debug-leaking an unknown variant's payload) plus a parent-dir fsync; recovery switched
  from newline-heal to truncation. 4 regression tests added, all green. Two limitations
  reconciled as documented trade-offs (the sink cannot scrub raw values by design;
  single-live-sink index coupling). Full record in `docs/decisions.md`.

## 2026-07-17 - T06: implemented `vg-policy` PolicyEngine (`LayeredPolicyEngine`)

Implemented `vg_core::PolicyEngine` in `crates/vg-policy` (was an empty stub). The engine
loads up to three JSON policy packs (global required; repo/session optional), signature-checks
each (Phase 1 stub), merges them session-over-repo-over-global, then validates and resolves
into a query-ready policy. Answers all six trait methods: `classify_entity`,
`classify_artefact`, `destination_allows_masked_only`, `demask_allowed`, `version`, `load`.

The security-load-bearing rule (`demask_allowed` hard-denies `RemoteModelPrompt` /
`ObservabilitySink` for any actor) is enforced in code above the config layer, so no pack can
override it; verified with `vg_core::conformance::assert_policy_engine_denies_hard_deny_destinations`
and a dedicated malicious-pack regression test.

### Changed / created files

- `crates/vg-policy/Cargo.toml` — added `serde` (derive) + `serde_json` deps.
- `crates/vg-policy/src/lib.rs` — module wiring + crate docs (was stub-only).
- `crates/vg-policy/src/config.rs` — new: serde pack schema, 3-layer merge, resolution,
  signature stub, entity/class string mappings, unit tests.
- `crates/vg-policy/src/engine.rs` — new: `LayeredPolicyEngine` + `PolicyEngine` impl.
- `crates/vg-policy/fixtures/*.policy.json` — new: global/repo/session example packs plus
  invalid-class, malformed, and malicious-hard-deny fixtures for failure-mode tests.
- `crates/vg-policy/tests/policy.rs` — new: behavioural + conformance tests.
- `Cargo.lock` — added the `serde`/`serde_json` edges to `vg-policy` (no new packages; both
  already resolved transitively via `criterion`).

### Decisions

Full record in `docs/decisions.md`'s 2026-07-17 T06 entry. Headline: policy-pack format is
**JSON** (not TOML/YAML per ADR-007) because cargo can't run in this dispatch sandbox to
regenerate `Cargo.lock`, and `serde_json` is already locked while `toml`/`serde_yaml` are not.
Format is trivially swappable later; flagged as a follow-up to reconcile with ADR-007.

### Assumptions / constraints

- Could not run `cargo build`/`clippy`/`fmt`/`test` — cargo and rustfmt are blocked in this
  sandbox (every invocation returned "requires approval"). Code and formatting were
  hand-verified against rustfmt 100-col defaults and clippy::all; **CI must run the full
  gate.** This is the same no-toolchain constraint that affected T04 (`vg-core` keying).

### Next Actions

- Run `cargo build --locked` / `clippy -D warnings` / `fmt --check` / `test` in CI to confirm
  the hand-verified gate; fix any drift.
- Reconcile policy-pack format with ADR-007 (switch to TOML, or amend ADR-007 to accept JSON)
  once the lock can be regenerated.
- T07 (`vg-core` pipeline wiring) consumes this engine via `Policy { engine, vault, audit }`.

### Validation status

- **Not machine-validated this session** (no toolchain). Logic, types, and formatting
  hand-verified. Unit + integration tests written but not executed here.


## 2026-07-17 - T08 built: `vg-parsers` (headless dispatch, compiler unreachable)

### What happened

Implemented `vg_core::Parser` across `crates/vg-parsers/src/`: `json.rs`, `yaml.rs`, `toml.rs`,
`csv.rs`, `log.rs`, `diff.rs`, `env.rs`, and `rust.rs` (tree-sitter, Rust as the source
language), a shared `util.rs`, an `all_parsers()` registry in `lib.rs`, and a cross-crate
integration test. Every `parse` is written to the never-panic contract — best-effort spans over
empty/truncated/binary/unbalanced input — and each module carries an
`assert_parser_never_panics` battery of genuinely adversarial buffers, plus a registry-wide
battery in `lib.rs`.

### Changed / created files

- `crates/vg-parsers/Cargo.toml` — added `regex`, `serde_yaml`, `toml`, `tree-sitter`,
  `tree-sitter-rust` deps and a `vg-detectors` dev-dep (for the integration test).
- `crates/vg-parsers/src/{lib,util,json,yaml,toml,csv,log,diff,env,rust}.rs` — new.
- `crates/vg-parsers/tests/detector_integration.rs` — new (cross-crate).
- `docs/decisions.md`, `docs/risks.md`, `.hekton/risk-register.yaml` (RISK-0011),
  `docs/next-actions.md`, `docs/build-log/2026-07-17-parsers-that-refuse-to-panic.md`.

### Decisions

Full record in `docs/decisions.md`'s 2026-07-17 T08 entry: source-language choice (Rust),
hand-rolled JSON tokenizer (serde_json gives no offsets and aborts early), serde_yaml/toml used
as well-formedness gates with hand-rolled line-scan spans, `.env` inline-`#`-is-not-a-comment
rule, and the mandated cross-crate classification below.

### Cross-crate finding (required)

`detector_integration.rs` feeds real parser `Span`s into `vg_detectors::all_detectors()` and
pins that the detectors' `_spans` parameter is a no-op today. Classified as an **expected,
stage-appropriate gap** (not a defect): the T03 detectors scan the whole buffer, which is a
superset of structure-scoped scanning; the span-threading pipeline is T07 (Wave C); and the
no-op is now test-pinned so it can't silently change. Flagged span-awareness as the natural
T07-era fix for the 2026-07-16 entropy/phone false positives.

### Validation status

- **NOT compiled/tested in-session** — every `cargo`/`rustc`/`python` invocation is
  approval-gated with no human in a one-shot dispatch (same constraint as T04). Code written for
  correctness/panic-safety by inspection.
- **Must run at PR review:** `cargo build` to **regenerate and commit `Cargo.lock`** (4 new deps
  — all `--locked` CI jobs fail until then), then `cargo test -p vg-parsers && cargo clippy
  --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo fmt --check`. Verify the `tree-sitter`/`tree-sitter-rust`
  version pair resolves. See RISK-0011.

### Next actions

- Regenerate `Cargo.lock`, verify build/test/clippy/fmt, confirm tree-sitter pins (RISK-0011).
- Re-run the census ladder's parser+detector rung after T08 lands, per the 2026-07-16 Codex plan.

### Mind-palace updated

- No (vault mutation not authorised; repo-local docs updated).

## Session: T07 — wired the masking pipeline (`scan`/`mask`) + contract v1.1

### What changed

- **`crates/vg-core/src/api.rs`** — replaced the `scan`/`mask` `todo!()` bodies with the real
  pipeline. `scan`: first-`can_parse` parser for spans, then every detector over the full raw
  buffer (spans enrichment only). `mask`: classify artefact (Block short-circuits to an empty
  pack + `AuditEvent::Block`, `blocked_artefacts = 1`, nothing interned) → detect (full buffer,
  latency measured here) → resolve overlaps (specific entity beats generic entropy `Secret`, then
  longer span; never double-mask) → per-entity Mask (`vault.intern`) / IrreversibleRedact /
  entity-Block (`[REDACTED:TYPE]`, never interned) / Pass, applied back-to-front → one
  `AuditEvent::Scan` written and returned. Added helpers `parser_spans`, `resolve_overlaps`,
  `spans_overlap`, `specificity`, `redaction_marker`, `detector_version`. **Signature change:**
  `mask` gained `ctx: &Context`.
- **`crates/vg-core/Cargo.toml`** — dev-deps on `vg-parsers`, `vg-vault`, `vg-policy`, `vg-audit`,
  `tempfile`, `criterion`; a `[[bench]]` for `mask_pipeline`.
- **`crates/vg-core/tests/pipeline.rs`** — e2e mask over a mixed fixture through the real
  detectors/parsers/policy-fixture/temp-keyed vault/temp audit sink: same value → same placeholder;
  raw values excluded (via the conformance helper, incl. a per-value property loop); `.env` Block;
  irreversible-redact never interned (`mapping_count == 0` via a fresh vault handle). Plus a `scan`
  test.
- **`crates/vg-core/tests/pipeline_latency_gate.rs`** — plain-`#[test]` CI latency gate for the
  full pipeline (the `vg-detectors/tests/latency_gate.rs` pattern, looser slack for vault+audit I/O).
- **`crates/vg-core/benches/mask_pipeline.rs`** — criterion bench for `mask` on the reference
  artefact (compile-checked in CI).
- **`docs/architecture/interface-contracts.md`** — bumped to **v1.1**: `mask(input, ctx, policy,
  ns)`, inline §2 contract-change note, Versioning entry.
- **`docs/decisions.md`** — ADR-012 row + full 2026-07-18 T07 entry (contract change rationale,
  pipeline order, recorded assumptions, demask-owner note, validation status).

### Decisions / assumptions

- Contract change via the sanctioned explicit-`ctx` fix (not `Policy`-smuggling, not
  caller-precomputed findings). `detector_version` = sorted detector ids joined `+`. Counts tally
  handled findings only (Pass is a no-op). Non-UTF-8 handled via `from_utf8_lossy` (lossless for
  the ASCII-shaped deterministic detectors). Pipeline emits no `DemaskDecision` — the vault owns
  demask attribution in Phase 1. All recorded in `docs/decisions.md`.

### Risks

- RISK: no in-session compiler (headless dispatch; `cargo`/`rustc` approval-gated). Code written
  for correctness by inspection against the merged implementations — **must be built/tested at PR

### Validation status

- Not compiled/run in-session. **At PR review:** `cargo build` (expect `Cargo.lock` unchanged),
